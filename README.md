1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BitCode32/Fledasty.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd Fledasty
```

3. Create build directory and navigate to it:
```bash
mkdir Build && cd Build
```

4. Run CMake to configure project:
```bash
cmake ..
```

5. Build the project:
```bash
cmake --build . --config Release
```
To build in debug use:
```bash
cmake --build . 
```

## Running the engine
After building there will be an example application that you can find. The compiled executable will typically be located in the build directory:
```bash
.\FledastyApp.exe
``` 
The library file will also be include in the same folder usually as Fledasty.lib for windows or Fledasty.a for linux. To use the library file you will need to copy the Fledasty folder containing the header files and follow the setup process for a library in the build system you are using.
